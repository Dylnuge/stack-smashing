These are hints for example 3.

Use them as you wish, but I recommend trying on your own first and coming here
if you get stuck. One good way to portion these out might be to only open one
hint file every 15 minutes.

You do you, but remember, once you "spoil" how these work it's hard to go back.

The solution.md file I _really_ recommend not opening until you finish. It can
help you understand _why_ your exploit works.
